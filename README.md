This is my template for setting a Nextjs project. Use this for JavaScript projects. A TypeScript alternative is on the way soon.

## How to

1. Setup
    > Create an alias for this
    ```sh
    npx create-next-app <PROJECT_NAME> -e https://github.com/christiannwamba/next-template
    ```
2. Install dependencies
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3. Run
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
